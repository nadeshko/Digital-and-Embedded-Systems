EE2B University Course

# Aims
Take a bare microprocessor and to convert it into a working micro-controller system programmed using the C language.
Use IO-mapped data structures to talk to interface pins.
Consider the basic functionality of a synchronous finite state machine and the equivalent implementation on a processor.
Combine multiple, disjoint program fragments together into one package that can be rapidly demonstrated.
Implementlogical bit-wise operations in software.
Implement look-up tables on both inputs and outputs (lambda logic) of synthesised finite state machines.
