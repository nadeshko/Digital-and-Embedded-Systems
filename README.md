# Asynchronous Finite State Machine Implementation Electronic Lock - Lab 3 Aims
- Implement a sophisticated asynchronous digital circuit on a programmable logic device.
- A working circuit, thorough simulation and verification procedures targeted as written evidence during legal proceedings.

# Using the C language on a PIC Processor - Lab 4 Aims
- Take a bare mplement a sophisticated asynchronous digital circuit on a programmable logic device.microprocessor and to convert it into a working micro-controller system programmed using the C language.
- Use IO-mapped data structures to talk to interface pins.
- Consider the basic functionality of a synchronous finite state machine and the equivalent implementation on a processor.
- Combine multiple, disjoint program fragments together into one package that can be rapidly demonstrated.
- Implementlogical bit-wise operations in software.
- Implement look-up tables on both inputs and outputs (lambda logic) of synthesised finite state machines.

# Integrated Mechatronic Project Wire-Following Signal Generator - Lab 5 Aims
- Interface a 12-bit digital-to-analogue converter to an 18F27K40 processors using an SPI interface.
- Generate a hardware-controlled latch signal to synchronise thedigital-to-analogue converter using a PWM timer device.
- Use the Pulse Width Modulated (PWM)hardware-controlled latch signal to generate an interrupt function.   This function will output the next value to the digital-to-analogue converter.
- Use Matlab to generate look-up table values andcorresponding C statements.
- Switch between 1kHz, 2kHz and summed output signals implementedusing look-up tables to provide Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) functionality.
- Demonstrate the concepts of offset binary notation used by many digital-to-analogue converters.

# USB and Serial Interfacing - Lab 6 Aims
- To design, implement and test a USB and serial interface.
- To implement an interrupt handler, circular receive buffer and command interpreter in C.
- To implement a USB controlled PWM modulecapable of acting on human-entered text strings.
